All figures show genome-wide signals and correlations between RADD (replication-associated DNA damage), AP (AP-seq apurinic/apyrimidinic sites), and −vIP scores.

- **Chromosome plots**: signals are aggregated into 100 kb bins, rank-normalized, and Gaussian-smoothed (σ = 10 bins) for visualization only.
- **Correlation analyses**: signals are aggregated at varying bin sizes (200 bp to 1 Mb).

## Root

### `evolution_of_corr_spearman.tsv`
Spearman correlation between each pair of signals (RADD vs −vIP, AP vs −vIP, RADD vs AP) computed at increasing aggregation sizes (200 bp to 1 Mb). Columns: `agg_size`, `RADD vs vipper`, `vipper vs AP`, `RADD vs AP`.

## chr/

### `{chr}.svg` (e.g. `chr19.svg`)
**Figure 1.** Two-panel figure per chromosome:
- **Top**: chromosome ideogram (GRCh38 cytobands) with centromere highlighted.
- **Bottom**: rank-normalized, Gaussian-smoothed genomic signal for RADD (green), AP (blue), and −vIP (orange) across the chromosome length. Gaps > 500 kb (e.g. centromeric regions) are shown as discontinuities.

## supplementary/

### `evolution_of_corr_spearman.svg`
Line plot of Spearman correlations (ρ) between signal pairs as a function of aggregation size (log x-axis). A dashed vertical line marks the 20 kb reference aggregation size.

### `correlations_evolution_wells_scatter.svg`
Scatter plot of ρ(well density, RADD) vs ρ(well density, AP) across all combinations of well pH thresholds (7.2, 7.4, 7.6, 7.8, −vIP) and aggregation sizes. Point size encodes aggregation size; color encodes the well metric.

### `correlations_evolution_wells_line.svg`
Two-panel line plot showing ρ(well density, RADD) and ρ(well density, AP) as a function of aggregation size (log x-axis), with one line per well metric.

### `correlations_corrected_evolution_wells_scatter.svg`
Same as `correlations_evolution_wells_scatter.svg` but correlations are partial-corrected for GC content using the formula:
$$
ρ_{corrected} = \frac{ρ(metric, target) − ρ(metric, GC) \cdot ρ(GC, target)}{\sqrt{(1−ρ(metric,GC)²)\cdot(1−ρ(GC,target)²)}}
$$
### `correlations_corrected_evolution_wells_line.svg`
Same as `correlations_evolution_wells_line.svg` but using GC-corrected correlations.
