All files report the correlation between the vIP score and mutational context enrichment (F) across three databases (**cosmic**, **somamutdb**, **clinvar**) and their union (**all**), broken down by mutation type.

F is computed per k-mer context as:


$$F = \log\!\left(\frac{\text{mutation count in context and subdataset} / \text{total mutations in subdataset}}{\text{genome-wide k-mer frequency}}\right)$$
where subdataset is the dataset filter for the same mutation type (intronic, UTR, ...)


Contexts are standardized to the pyrimidine strand. The vIP score per context is computed with `VIPER.compute_double_strand_score`. Correlation is computed across all contexts within each mutation type.

- **Correlation analyses**: Aggregation is at the k-mer context level (32 contexts for 3N, 512 for 5N).
- **GC correction** (corrected files): partial correlation controlling for the GC count of the k-mer context, using the formula r(vIP, F | GC).

## Root

### `{kmer}_{method}.tsv`
Pearson or Spearman r between vIP and F. Rows: mutation type. Columns: `type`, `cosmic`, `somamutdb`, `clinvar`, `all`.

- `3N_pearsonr.tsv` — 3-mer context, Pearson r
- `3N_spearmanr.tsv` — 3-mer context, Spearman r
- `5N_pearsonr.tsv` — 5-mer context, Pearson r
- `5N_spearmanr.tsv` — 5-mer context, Spearman r

### `{method}_correlation_evolution.svg`
**Figure 4.** Line plot of Pearson or Spearman r between F̄ and v̄IP as a function of motif size (3, 5, 7, 9, 11-mer), for silent mutations only. One line per database (cosmic, somamutdb, clinvar).
