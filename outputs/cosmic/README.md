All figures show correlations between COSMIC SBS mutational signatures and vIP scores.
The enrichment F is computed as log(signature_probability / trinucleotide_frequency).

### `cosmic_sbs_etiologies_pearson.svg`
**Figure 3.** Bar chart of Pearson r between each COSMIC SBS signature's enrichment profile (F̄, averaged over the 32 pyrimidine contexts) and the mean vIP score (v̄IP). Bars are colored by etiology category (DNA repair, Electrophilic, UV-Light, Other, Unknown). Asterisks mark signatures with p ≤ 0.05.

### `cosmic_sbs_etiologies_stats.tsv`
Table joining signature etiologies with correlation statistics. Columns: `signature`, `proposed_etiology`, `classification`, `pearson`, `pvalue_p`, `spearman`, `pvalue_s`.

### `{REF}>{ALT}.svg` (e.g. `C>A.svg`)
Pearson r bar charts restricted to a single substitution type (16 trinucleotide contexts), no abundance threshold applied.

### `{REF}>{ALT}_threshold_05.svg`
Same as above but signatures whose total coefficient (sum of probabilities across contexts) is < 5% of the maximum are excluded.

### `SBS_type_heatmap.svg`
Heatmap of Pearson r with dimensions (substitution type × signature). Includes a mean row and mean column. Signature labels are colored by etiology category.

### `mean_sbs_category_width.svg`
For each substitution type, grouped bars showing r(F_category, vIP) where signatures of the same etiology are summed before computing F. **Bar width** encodes the relative weight of that substitution type for each etiology (proportional to total_coef).

### `mean_sbs_category_opacity.svg`
Same as `mean_sbs_category_width.svg` but bars have fixed equal width and **bar opacity** encodes the relative weight instead.

### `detail_signatures/details_{SIG}.svg`
Two-panel scatter plot for a given SBS signature:
- **Left**: 32-point aggregated view — F̄ vs v̄IP with regression line and Pearson r.
- **Right**: per-substitution-type scatter — each of the 6 SBS types plotted separately with individual regression lines and Pearson r in the legend.

### `detail_signatures/details_{SIG}_no_outlier.svg`
Same as above but low-probability contexts (probability < 1e-6) are excluded before computing F.
