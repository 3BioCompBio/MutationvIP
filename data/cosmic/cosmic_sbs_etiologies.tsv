signature	proposed_etiology	classification
SBS1	An endogenous mutational process initiated by spontaneous or enzymatic deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine which generates G:T mismatches in double stranded DNA. Failure to detect and remove these mismatches prior to DNA replication results in fixation of the T substitution for C.	Electrophilic
SBS2	Attributed to activity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases on the basis of similarities in the sequence context of cytosine mutations caused by APOBEC enzymes in experimental systems. APOBEC3A is probably responsible for most mutations in human cancer, although APOBEC3B may also contribute (these differ in the sequence context two bases 5’ to the mutated cytosine, see 1,536 mutation classification signature extraction). SBS2 mutations may be generated directly by DNA replication across uracil or by error prone polymerases replicating across abasic sites generated by base excision repair removal of uracil.	Other
SBS3	Defective homologous recombination-based DNA damage repair which manifests predominantly as small indels and genome rearrangements due to abnormal double strand break repair but also in the form of this base substitution signature.	DNA repair
SBS4	Associated with tobacco smoking. Its profile is similar to the mutational spectrum observed in experimental systems exposed to tobacco carcinogens such as benzo[a]pyrene. SBS4 is, therefore, likely due to direct DNA damage by tobacco smoke mutagens.	Electrophilic
SBS5	Unknown. SBS5 mutational burden is increased in bladder cancer samples with ERCC2 mutations and in many cancer types due to tobacco smoking.	Unknown
SBS6	SBS6 is associated with defective DNA mismatch repair and is found in microsatellite unstable tumours.	DNA repair
SBS7a	SBS7a/SBS7b/SBS7c/SBS7dare found in cancers of the skin from sun exposed areas and are thus likely to be due to exposure to ultraviolet light. SBS7a may possibly be the consequence of just one of the two major known UV photoproducts, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or 6-4 photoproducts. However, there is currently no evidence for this hypothesis and it is unclear which of these photoproducts may be responsible for SBS7a.	UV-Light
SBS7b	SBS7a/SBS7b/SBS7c/SBS7dare found in cancers of the skin from sun exposed areas and are likely to be due to exposure to ultraviolet light. SBS7b may possibly be the consequence of just one of the two major known UV photoproducts, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or 6-4 photoproducts. However, there is no evidence for this hypothesis and it is unclear which of these photoproducts may be responsible for SBS7b.	UV-Light
SBS7c	SBS7a/SBS7b/SBS7c/SBS7dare found in cancers of the skin from sun exposed areas and are likely to be due to exposure to ultraviolet light. SBS7c is possibly the consequence of translesion DNA synthesis by enzymes with propensity to insert T, rather than A, opposite ultraviolet induced thymidine and cytidine photodimers. The preponderance of T>A rather than T>C mutations may reflect the heavier burden of thymidine compared to cytidine dimers induced by UV light.	UV-Light
SBS7d	SBS7a/SBS7b/SBS7c/SBS7d are found in cancers of the skin from sun exposed areas and are likely to be due to exposure to ultraviolet light. SBS7d is possibly the consequence of translesion DNA synthesis by error-prone polymerases with greater propensity to insert G, rather than A, opposite UV light induced thymidine and cytidine photodimers.	UV-Light
SBS8	Unknown.	Unknown

SBS12	Unknown.	Unknown
SBS13	Attributed to activity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases on the basis of similarities in the sequence context of cytosine mutations caused by APOBEC enzymes in experimental systems. APOBEC3A is probably responsible for most mutations in human cancer, although APOBEC3B may also contribute (these differ in the sequence context two bases 5’ to the mutated cytosine, see 1536 mutation classification signature extraction). SBS13 mutations are likely generated by error prone polymerases (such as REV1) replicating across abasic sites generated by base excision repair removal of uracil.	Other
